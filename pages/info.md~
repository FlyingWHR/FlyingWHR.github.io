For years I&#39;ve been programming for coursework, I have finally decided to build this website to showcase some of my work and motivate me to do something extra.

With a background in physics and eletrical engineering and interest in programming, I transfered to computer engineering to explore more. Some of my course work covered *Data Structures*, *system engineering(Unix architecture)*, *network communications(protocals and routing)*,*Big data(intro)*. 

I&#39;m currently building an app on iOS using swift language which I&#39;m also learning, hopefully it can be shown here next week.

## Huge thanks to...

[Phlow][1] for his awesome [Jekyll][2] theme, this website is hosted through [GitHub Pages][3].

#### Yours sincerelly, Hongru.
